# Webm file duration corruptor:
I made this to better understand how memory works and because of videos that would circulate in discord where the length would extend as the video plays.

---

## How to use:

./main fileInp fileOut
>
main - name of compiled program
fileInp - add a path to the file you want to read from
fileOut - location of video with broken duration

make sure fileInp and fileOut are diffrent, as you will just end up deleting the inpfile.
